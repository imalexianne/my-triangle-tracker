### Description

```
my-triangle-tracker is about making the interface logic and business logic where the interface logic is a form made by three input places where the end user have to enter three different numbers which are the three lengths of the triangle and one button where the end user click to find which type of triangle. 
 I used HTML ,CSS, javascript and Markdown languages.

| Behavior                                                         | Input     |  Output      |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------| :--------:| -----------: |
| when i put in 3 equal numbers it will say equilateral            | 10,10,10  | Equilateral  |
| when i put in 2 equal numbers it will say  isosceles             | 30,30,50 |  Isosceles   |
| when i put in 3 different numbers it will say scalene            | 30,40,50  | Scalene      |
| when the sum of two values is less than or equal to the third will say Not a Triangle     | 10,34,90  | No Triangle     |

### User story

As user, I want to enter the length values of the three sides of my triangle in the application.
...
After submitting my values, the application should tell me what type of triangle my values will produce, whether an isosceles, equilateral, scalene or NO triangle at all.
...
For an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal.
For an isosceles triangle, two sides are exactly equal.
For a scalene triangle, none of the sides is equal. However, the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.
Most importantly, if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle can not be formed using those values.
