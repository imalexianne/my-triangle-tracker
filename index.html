    <h1>TRIANGLE TRACKER</h1>
    <div class="triangle">
       <p>This project is about making the interface logic and business logic where the interface logic is a form made by three input places where the end user have to enter three different numbers which are the three lengths of the triangle and one button where the end user click to find which type of triangle. </p>
       <p>To be a triangle the sum of two sides taken randomly must be greater than the left one here value1 is the first side, value2 is the second side and value3 is the third side</p>
       <p>From these conditions:value1+value2>value3 and value1+value3>value2 and value2+value3>value1.</p> 
       <p>If any of the three conditions is false there is no triangle and alert will say Not a triangle.</p>
       <p>If all these conditions are true, then you have a triangle and the user want to know which type of triangle he made</p>
       <p>Conditions to know the type of triangle:</p>
       <p>If value1=value2 and value1=value3 and value2=value3, the user has an equilateral triangle.</p>
       <p>If value1=value2 or value1=value3 or value2=value3, the user has an isoceles triangle.</p>
       <p>If all the above two conditions are not, now it is a scalene triangle.</p>
        
    </div>
    <h3>Now you are wellcome to try your values!!!!!</h3>
     value1: <input type="number" id="value1">
     value2: <input type="number" id="value2"> 
     value3: <input type="number" id="value3">
     <button onclick="myFunction()">check</button>
