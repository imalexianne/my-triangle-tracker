    <h1>TRIANGLE TRACKER</h1>
    <div class="triangle">
       <p>This project is about making the interface logic and business logic where the interface logic is a form made by three input places where the end user have to enter three different numbers which are the three lengths of the triangle and one button where the end user click to find which type of triangle. </p>
       <p>To be a triangle the sum of two sides taken randomly must be greater than the left one here value1 is the first side, value2 is the second side and value3 is the third side</p>
       <p>All these conditions must be true: value1+value2>value3 and value1+value3>value2 and value2+value3>value1</p>
    </div>
     value1: <input type="number" id="myNumber">
     value2: <input type="number" id="myNumber"> 
     value3: <input type="number" id="myNumber">
     <button onclick="myFunction()">check</button>
